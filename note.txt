can we create a nestedlist in flat list or custom list?
yes we can
but selection list gives us default option for preparing the nested list.
we have to do everything manually in other flat list and custom list.


where to use section list and where to use flat list?
if the requirement is that we have single array and need to print single value, then we
will use flat list. but if there is nested list, then the better option will be section list.
